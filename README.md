# GARFIELD
Genetic Algorithm Resonator Fitting for Impedance ExtrapoLation and Determination

An example on how the script is working can be found in the notebook named "Final_version.ipynb"

Roadmap :
Add extrapolated resonator wake function and impedance formulas (with example).
Add constraints on resonator parameters (i.e. forcing two resonators resonant frequency to be spaced more than a certain value).
